# Wellcome Collection's Javanese manuscripts

Wellcome Collection holds eleven Javanese manuscripts. Six of these were purchased at London auctions between 1916 and 1934, while the remaining five are of unknown provenance.

The six first manuscripts (Javanese 1-6) are *Yusup* romances on palm-leaves, half of them incomplete or out of order. Of the remaining, three (Javanese 7-9) contain various stories, instructions in Islamic mysticism (Javanese 8), and court genealogies (Javanese 9). Javanese 10 and 11 are fragments covering topics ranging from divination and mysticism to religious teachings and legal texts.

The information in these TEI files is drawn from the following catalogue:

The TEI files in this repository were created by members of teams from across Wellcome Collection.
