# Wellcome Collection's Hebrew Manuscripts

Wellcome Collection holds 94 manuscripts in Hebrew. Those with known provenance were purchased from London auction houses between 1909 and 1934.

The collection is divided into two series:

* The A series consists of 36 manuscripts containing medical material and miscellaneous matters.
* The B series contains 58 Biblical manuscripts, ranging from Torah scrolls to paper fragments.

The files in this repository are based on cataloguing information from the following catalogue:

* Allan N, "Catalogue of Hebrew manuscripts in the Wellcome Institute, London," in **Journal of Semitic Studies** 27 (2) (1982): 193-220.

The TEI files in this repository were created by members of teams from across Wellcome Collection.
