# Wellcome Collection's Malay Manuscripts

Wellcome Collection holds ten Malay manuscripts, nine of which (Malay 1-9) are from the collection of D.F.A. Hervey, a late nineteenth century British colonial administrator of the Straits Civil Service. The manuscripts include lists of terms and uses for plants and animals, notes on legal practices, and prices of rice varieties, and often retain Hervey's minutes, giving crucial context to the work of his informants.

The main catalogues for Wellcome Collection's Malay manuscripts are:

* Ellen RF, Hooker MB and AC Milner, "The Hervey Malay Collection in the Wellcome Institute", in **Journal of the Malayasian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society** 54 (1) (1981): 82-92.

* Ricklefs MC and Voorhoeve P,"Catalogue of Malay manuscripts in the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine" from "Indonesian manuscripts in Great Britain : Addenda et Corrigenda," in **Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies** 45 (2) (1982): 312-15.

Additional cataloguing and revision was courtesy of Li-Xuan Teo.
