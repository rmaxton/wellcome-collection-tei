# Wellcome Collection's Batak Manuscripts

Wellcome Collection holds twenty-four Batak manuscripts, most of which are described in this repository. The items with known provenance came to Wellcome through auction purchases in 1915 and 1933. They include scrolls of paper tied around bamboo sticks, bamboo strips, various bone objects, and eleven *pustaha*s. *Pustaha*s typically consist of tree bark pages between hardcovers held in place by a rattan band. An opened *pustaha* from Wellcome Collection can be viewed [here](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/gb5gq6vc). 

The items in this repository cover a variety of topics, including a handbook for the use of gunpowder and guns, works on divination, medical texts for the treatment of a broad range of ailments, and protective magic. The information in these TEI files are collated from the following two catalogues:

* M.C. Ricklefs and P. Voorhoeve, 'Catalogue of Batak manuscripts in the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine' from *Indonesian Manuscripts in Great Britain: a catalogue of Manuscripts in Indonesian languages in British Public Collections*, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977, p. 25.
* M.C. Ricklefs and P. Voorhoeve, 'Catalogue of Batak manuscripts in the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine' from 'Indonesian manuscripts in Great Britain: Addenda et Corrigenda', *Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies*, 45(2), 1982, pp. 303-305.

The TEI files in this repository were created by members of teams from across Wellcome Collection.
